<h1>Snake Game - Anime Edition</h1>
 Welcome to my Snakeland! 
 <p>Let's dive into the classic Snake experience with a twist of anime charm. This multiplayer game allows up to two players to navigate through three challenging levels, each featuring unique mazes with increasing obstacles.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Multiplayer Fun:</b> Play with a friend and see who can navigate the maze and collect the most points! One player uses the arrow keys and the other player uses the keys WSAD for up down left and right movements.
- <b>Three Levels of Difficulty:</b> After choosing one or two-player mode, you can test your snake skill with three different levels corresponding to mazes, each presenting its own set of challenges.
- <b>Variety of Food:</b> Collect two different types of food, each offering different point values. If your snake eats the grape, it will gain 1 point, but if your snake drinks the water, it will gain 2 points, well simply because water is more important :) Choose wisely to maximize your score!
- <b>Survival Mechanics:</b> When one snake dies, the other snake can continue the game until it hits the wall. It's not the other snake's fault that your snake die :) Keep the game going and aim for a high score!
- <b>Immersive Design:</b> Experience the game with captivating visuals designed using Adobe Photoshop, featuring anime characters and meticulously crafted elements like snake skins, walls, and food.
- <b>Sound Enhancements:</b> Immerse yourself in the gameplay with a soundtrack that complements the action, creating a more engaging experience with the help of the SFML library.
<p>Get ready for a nostalgic journey with a modern and anime-inspired touch. Let the snake adventure begin!</p>
